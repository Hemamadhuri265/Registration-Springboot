# Registration-Springboot


This **Registration Page** built with **Spring Boot** allows users to create an account by submitting their name, email, and password. The form includes validation to ensure data accuracy. Upon successful submission, user details are saved to a database (e.g., MySQL), and users are redirected to a login page. The application uses **Spring MVC**, **Spring Security**, and **Thymeleaf** for seamless interaction and security.
